# Linting & Formatting

- Respect existing ESLint and Prettier configuration.
- Do not disable rules unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not introduce new lint rules.
- Do not reformat unrelated files.
- Fix lint errors introduced by your changes.

Code should pass type-check, ESLint, and Prettier without manual cleanup.
