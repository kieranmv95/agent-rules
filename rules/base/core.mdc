# Core

## Intent

Produce readable, predictable, maintainable code.
Do not introduce clever abstractions.
Match existing patterns.

Senior-owned codebase. Assume high standards.

## Before Changing Code

- Read relevant files fully.
- Follow existing patterns.
- Do not refactor unless explicitly asked.
- Do not introduce new dependencies.

## Style

Readability > compression.
Explicit > clever.
Simple > abstract.
