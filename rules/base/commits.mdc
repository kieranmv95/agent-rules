# Commits

Follow Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Use simple types:
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- refactor: internal change, no behaviour change
- chore: tooling / config / maintenance
- docs: documentation only

Rules:
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Clear, concise messages.
- No mixed concerns in a single commit.
- Do not commit unrelated formatting changes.

Example:
feat: add onboarding step validation
fix: prevent crash when user has no profile image
