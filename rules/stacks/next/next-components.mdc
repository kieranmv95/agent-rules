# Next.js Components

- Components are Server Components by default. Do not add `"use client"` unless required.
- Add `"use client"` only when using hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers.
- Minimise the client boundary. Extract interactive parts into small Client Components.
- Do not pass non-serializable props (functions, classes) from Server to Client Components.
- Prefer composition: pass Server Components as `children` to Client Components when possible.
