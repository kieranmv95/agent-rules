# Next.js App Router

- Follow file-based routing with the App Router (`app/` directory).
- Use `page.tsx` for routes, `layout.tsx` for shared layouts, `loading.tsx` for suspense fallbacks, `error.tsx` for error boundaries, `not-found.tsx` for 404 pages.
- Keep route files thin. Move logic to components/hooks.
- Use route groups `(groupName)` to organise without affecting URL paths.
- Prefer co-locating related components alongside their route segment.
- Use `generateMetadata` or `metadata` export for per-route metadata.
