These rules are automatically picked up by AI coding agents (e.g., Cursor, Copilot) to guide code generation and review.

### Customizing Rules

- Edit any rule file in `.cursor/rules/` to tailor it to your project.
- Add new `.md` files to `.cursor/rules/` for additional rules.
- Re-run `agent-setup` to reset or switch stacks.

## Contributing

When adding new conventions to this project, update the relevant rule files so that AI agents stay aligned with the team's standards.
